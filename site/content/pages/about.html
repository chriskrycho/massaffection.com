<p>Welcome aboard the SSV Mass Affection—a husband-and-wife podcast discussing a play-through of Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3! (Maybe someday Andromeda, too—but we have a lot of ground to cover first.)</p>

<h2 id="whoarewe">Who are we?</h2>

<p>Well, we&#8217;re just nerds, really (though Chris is already an <a href="http://www.winningslowly.org">accomplished</a> <a href="http://www.newrustacean.com">podcaster</a>, and Jaimie has an amazing voice). But we love <a href="https://www.masseffect.com">Mass Effect</a>. We&#8217;ve sunk many, <em>many</em> hours into the game together over much of the last decade. Chris played the original Mass Effect when it came out a decade ago in 2007, and Jaimie watched him play various repeat play-throughs of ME, ME2, and ME3, including a run where Jaimie made all the decisions and Chris just did the mechanics. We&#8217;ve spent the last five years talking about it—everything from characterization to plot to game dynamics.</p>

<p>So we thought: why not talk about it <em>with an audience</em>? So… thanks for being our audience!</p>

<h2 id="theplay-throughplan">The play-through plan</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ll be playing in sequence through the main and character plots for Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3. Once we finish <em>that</em>, perhaps we&#8217;ll dive into Andromeda!</p>

<p>The current plan is to do all the main story missions, a few selected side plot missions of interest (Helena Blake, Conrad Verner, etc.), and a few crucial DLC items (see below). We&#8217;ll also let sponsors support side missions if so desired.</p>

<p>DLC we plan to tackle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mass Effect

<ul>
<li>Bring Down the Sky</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mass Effect 2

<ul>
<li>Zaeed</li>
<li>Kasumi</li>
<li>Shadow Broker</li>
<li>Arrival</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mass Effect 3

<ul>
<li>From Ashes (Javik)</li>
<li>Citadel</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>DLC we plan to skip (but in some cases will let sponsors support):</p>

<ul>
<li>Mass Effect

<ul>
<li>Pinnacle Station</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mass Effect 2

<ul>
