An abject failure of story-telling, in every possible way.

![Arrival](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/massaffection/arrival.jpg)

Jaimie makes bad puns and does a mean Kasumi impression. Chris rants about the horrible, no good, very bad ethics on display here. Both of them rant about the bad writing and the putting-the-characters-on-rails decisions the story team made.

…but hey, at least there's a Hackett appearance?
